# NDVI-Map
I created a series of NDVI to study the effects of wild fires in the National Vesuvius Park, Italy. The 1990 NDVI is a base to this analysis show casing the vegetation existant prior to the fires. The January 2017 NDVI show cases the situaton just before the firest and August right after the fires.
